# Audo-filtering-using-filters
Noise is removed from the audio with the help of three  filters. i.e. Bandpass filter, Band stop Filter and High pass Filter.FFT of all the 
signals is plotted to see the signal in frequency domain. Respective cut-off
frequency is given to eliminate the noise. Then after applying all three filters 
the filtered audio is obtained and its corresponding FFT is plotted.

## Learning Outcomes-
1. Through this project I learned multiple things such as plotting audio file 
in time and frequency domains.
2. I also got know terms like filter order, cut-off frequency and its 
corresponding python functions.
3. I got know various libraries such as matplot.lib.pylot ,scipy ,winsound 
and their corresponding functions for plotting, playing sound file etc.
4. I also saw functions in python which are used to calculate the FFT and to 
set the filters.
5. I got the know the flow of program to remove unwanted noise from 
audio
